      Given I open "http://52.39.162.23" url
      When "I" clicks "BriteErpDemo" button
      Then I log in as a "Inventory User4" using "in_4@info.com" and "alsfuh7we74"
      Then "user" clicks "Calendar" button

    When the user clicks on the Magnifying Glass icon in the far right side of the search bar
    Given user should see the icon in the Magnifying Glass change from a plus-sign to a minus-sign
    Then three new icons should be revealed below the Search Bar, Filters, Group By, and Favorites
    When the user clicks on the Advanced Search icon titled Group By and selects add custom groups
    Then the "<custom_groups>" should be displayed and is in Alpabetical order
